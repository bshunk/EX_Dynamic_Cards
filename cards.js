// Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled Create.
// When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM that includes it's own delete button. You decide the height/width of the card.
// When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.

// created variables to hold elements from html
let input = document.getElementById("userInput");
let createBtn = document.getElementById("createBtn");
let outputCard = document.getElementById("cardsOutput");
let deleteBtn = [];
let card = "";

// adds a click event listner to the create button and runs function createdCard when clicked
createBtn.addEventListener("click", createdCard);

// defines function createdCard
function createdCard() {
